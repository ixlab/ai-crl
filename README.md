# Classroom Readiness Levels for AI Tools (AI-CRL)
_Based on ideas by Anna Gawboy & Arnab Nandi_

### Unlocking the Potential of AI in Education
We are at an exciting frontier where "General Purpose" AI models and tools are entering educational spaces. These models and tools possess incredible **General Capability**, but to truly transform education, they must achieve high **Instructional Readiness**.

The **Classroom Readiness Levels (AI-CRL)** framework offers a shared language for developers and educators to bridge the gap between what AI models *can* do and what classrooms *need*. The framework evaluates the "Classroom Readiness" of a model or tool across three critical lanes: **Efficiency, Cognition, and Reliability.**

### Lane 1: Efficiency (The Labor Impact)
* **The Goal:** To move from "shifting labor" to "multiplying capacity."
* **The Research:** This lane is grounded in [Cognitive Load Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load). Effective learning requires minimizing *extraneous cognitive load* so that energy can be focused on actual learning.
* **The Opportunity:** Currently, some tools require significant "prompt engineering" or verification time (a "Correction Tax"). The goal is to build tools that act as **Multipliers (+3)**—automating rote tasks and formatting so that instructors can reallocate their time to high-value mentorship and students can focus on complex problem-solving.

### Lane 2: Cognition (The Pedagogical Impact)
* **The Goal:** To move from "solving" to "scaffolding."
* **The Research:** This lane relies on the concept of [Desirable Difficulty](https://bjorklab.psych.ucla.edu/research/) and [Instructional Scaffolding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding). Durable learning happens when students engage in the *process* of reaching an answer, not just receiving the output.
* **The Opportunity:** While a standard model might simply generate an essay (a "Cognitive Bypass"), a classroom-ready tool acts as a **Scaffold (+2)** or **Amplifier (+3)**. It can offer Socratic hints, break down complex problems, or help a student brainstorm, keeping them in their [Zone of Proximal Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development) and building stronger neural pathways.

### Lane 3: Reliability (The Trust Impact)
* **The Goal:** To move from "plausible" to "domain expert."
* **The Research:** This addresses [Epistemic Cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_cognition). The classroom is a high-stakes environment for truth. Students, often novices, need to trust the tools they learn with.
* **The Opportunity:** The next generation of educational AI is moving beyond generic responses to become **Domain Experts (+3)**. By integrating specific curriculum data and prioritizing factual accuracy, we can create tools that serve as reliable research assistants and trusted partners in discovery.

### How to Use the AI-CRL Scorecard

This scorecard is a design guide focusing on **Net Educational Impact**.

1.  **Assess the Tool:** Look at the specific implementation across the three lanes.
2.  **Aim for the Positive:**
    * **Efficiency:** Does it actually save time?
    * **Cognition:** Does it help the user think?
    * **Reliability:** Is it context-aware and accurate?
3.  **The "readiness" Standard:** The ideal tool scores positively in all three lanes. A tool that is highly efficient (+3) but pedagogically hollow (-2) is an opportunity for refinement.

### The Future of the Classroom
The AI-CRL is an invitation to collaborate. By prioritizing **Instructional Readiness**, we can ensure that AI doesn't just enter the classroom, but becomes a welcome and essential tool: supporting faculty, challenging students, and amplifying human intelligence.
